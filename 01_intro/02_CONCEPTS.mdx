## Bun Runtime for JavaScript

### Introduction
Bun is a modern JavaScript runtime and package manager that aims to be a fast all-in-one solution for building, testing, running, and deploying JavaScript applications. It is built with performance in mind, leveraging the power of native code and optimized compilers to speed up various aspects of development.

### Key Concepts

#### 1. **Runtime Features**
   - **Blazing Fast Performance:** Bun is designed to be faster than other JavaScript runtimes by utilizing native code and efficient memory handling.
   - **Built-in Package Manager:** Bun has an integrated package manager that eases the management of dependencies.
   - **Single Binary:** Bun is distributed as a single binary, simplifying installation and setup.

#### 2. **Bundling**
   Bun can bundle JavaScript and TypeScript code, along with dependencies, into a single file. This makes deploying applications simpler and faster.

#### 3. **Transpilation**
   Bun supports transpiling TypeScript to JavaScript out of the box, removing the need for additional tools like Babel or tsc for many use cases.

#### 4. **Testing**
   Bun includes built-in testing utilities, allowing developers to write and execute tests natively. This feature helps maintain the robustness of applications with minimal overhead.

#### 5. **Hot Module Reload (HMR)**
   Bun supports Hot Module Reloading for a seamless development experience. This means changes in the code are reflected in real-time without restarting the application.

### Setting Up
To get started with Bun, you can install it using the following script:
```sh
curl https://bun.sh/install | bash
```
After installation, you can start a new project with:

```sh
bun create <template> <project-name>
cd <project-name>
bun install
```

### Usage Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate the use of Bun in a JavaScript project:

1. **Create a new project:**
   ```sh
   bun create node server-app
   cd server-app
   ```

2. **Write a basic HTTP server:**
   ```js
   // server.js
   const http = require("http");

   const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
       res.statusCode = 200;
       res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
       res.end('Hello, World!\n');
   });

   const port = 3000;
   server.listen(port, () => {
       console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}/`);
   });
   ```

3. **Run the server:**
   ```sh
   bun server.js
   ```
